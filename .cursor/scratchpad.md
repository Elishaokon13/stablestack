# Codebase Study - StableStack

## Background and Motivation

**Original Request**: The user requested a comprehensive study of the StableStack codebase. This is a Next.js-based dashboard application with a unique "M.O.N.K.Y OS" theme, featuring a rebel/cyberpunk aesthetic. The application appears to be a mock operating system interface with dashboard functionality, chat system, and various UI components.

**New Project Vision**: Transform the StableStack codebase into a "Paystack for Web3" platform where:
- Users can create products and set prices
- Buyers pay with traditional cards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- Sellers receive payments converted to USDC and sent to their connected Web3 wallet
- Bridge between traditional finance and Web3 ecosystems
